# 📘 Capstone Project – WeCloudData  
**Data Management & Governance Bootcamp**

As data analysts, we designed and implemented a complete data pipeline and governance framework for a simulated **Learning Management System (LMS)** — integrating fragmented sources, performing data cleaning using `SQL` and `Python`, improving data quality, and delivering actionable insights.
